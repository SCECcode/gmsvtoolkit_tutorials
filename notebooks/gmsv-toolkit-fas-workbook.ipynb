    "SCEC's goal with GMSV Toolkit is to make existing, well verified, and useful software available to a broad seismological and engineering community of researchers interested in ground motion simulations validation. SCEC's GMSV Toolkit leverages over a decade of scientific, engineering, and software development work completed by dozens of SCEC contributors, including the groups working with the Broadband Platform, the GMSV TAG, the High-F group, among others.\n",

The training data package includes pre-computed FAS files for all stations (both simulated and observed data), but users are welcome to replace the short station list with the full station list in the examples above and regenerate the files themselves, it will just take a little longer."
